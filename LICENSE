IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF TOOLBOXAI, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

This license constitutes the entire agreement between the Licensor and the authorized user concerning ToolboxAI and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations, and discussions, whether oral or written. Any amendments must be in writing and signed by the Licensor.
